Software Design Document for The Gaming Room

The Gaming Room is a client of Creative Technology Solutions. The Gaming Room wants to create a web-based game that can run on multiple platforms. The game is
called Draw It or Lose It. It is loosely similar to a television gameshow called Win, Lose or Draw. The game would render an image from a collection of hundreds
of high-definition images, and the player will have to guess the correct name or phrase for the image.

The document illustrates the differences and their requirements between operating systems well. This document describes what software is needed for each different
operating system. It also describes their pros and cons which concluded to a single operating system to be used for the development of the software.

When developing the code for the software, is important to have what type of architecture design should be used to develop the software. The software design
document describes that a client-server architecture must be used in developing the code. This is helpful to know how to create the system of the software and to
create the code.

In designing the document, cloud based services should be more in consideration in developing the software. Server maintanence and uptime would not have to be a 
worry. This would be managed by a service.

The software design document interprets highly on the neccessity of efficiency. It is important to have an efficient design for a time based game. This would
ensure the game's fairness for when a player guesses the correct answer. It would not be fair for a user to be penalized if the game did not respond quick enough
to their answer. This affected in choosing how high definition images are downloaded to the game.

The software design document was created in meeting the client's requirements. However in creating the document, other technicalities that the client has not
mentioned should be considered too. For example, the client did not mention creating a software that loads images quickly. It was discovered later on that that
is very important in designing the software.
